 Summary:
 _Differences between classes and struct:
    +Similarity:
        _Classes & structs both let you create custom type with properties and method.

        _Classes can inherit other classes to use the super class properties and method.
        _Classes have deinitializers which is used to call when a class instance is destroyed.
        _Constants in classes isn's as strict as it is with structs. 
 
 _A class with the final keyword cannot be subclassed into any other class.
